My father is American and my mother is from Finland. 

I’m a musician. I make hip-hop, rnb, soul type of music. 

I would like for people to think of me as a kind hearted and open hearted person who thinks for himself and for other people as well. I would like to be seen as a helpful person, fun person to be around with. Somebody that has a sense of humour. But most importantly, I would like to be seen as a human being amongst other human beings.

An ideal world for me would be one without racism, one without a pandemic. No famine, no war, of course. People of all cultures, all religions, all races - should be able to live in peace and should not feel like they aren’t allowed to be who they are".</p>
